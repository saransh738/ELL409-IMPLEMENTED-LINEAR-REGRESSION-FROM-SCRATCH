# LINEAR REGRESSION
## PROBLEM STATEMENT

## PART 1:
The objective here is to implement the concepts of regression learnt in class via polynomial curve fitting. To recap, polynomial curve fitting is an example of regression. In regression, the objective is to learn a function that maps an input variable x to a continuous target variable t.

For the first part of this assignment, we provide a personalised input file that contains data of the form:

````
x 1 ,t 1
x 2 ,t 2
.
.
.
x 100 ,t 100

````

The relation between x and t is of the form

````
t = w0 + w1x + ::: + wMxM + ? 
````
